# Readme

**VPfunctions** is a Python library designed for extracting, processing, and visualizing data from measurement devices and software tools, which are commonly used in the Optical Metrology Research Group located at the Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna, Austria.

## Features

- **File Handling**: Extract filenames with specific extensions from directories, now supporting a variable root directory.
- **Data Parsing**: Parse and analyze measurement data from custom CSV formats, including files from specific devices and software tools:
  - **Rohde & Schwarz FSWP Phase Noise Analyzer**:
    - Noise files (AM Noise, Phase Noise, and Baseband Noise).
    - RF spectrum analyzer files.
  - **Yokogawa AQ6374 Optical Spectrum Analyzer** files.
  - **Thorlabs Redstone Optical Spectrum Analyzer** files.
  - **Thorlabs Powermeter Software** files.
  - **RP Fiber Power** simulation output files.
- **Noise Analysis**: Compute phase noise, frequency noise, timing jitter, fractional frequency noise, integrated RMS relative intensity noise (RIN), and more.
- **Optical Spectrum Analysis**: Compute the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), the center wavelength (CWL) and normalize optical spectra.
- **Visualization**: Generate consistent and customizable plots for various noise characteristics and save them automatically.
- **Optimized Functions**: All functions now feature:
  - Enhanced speed using NumPy operations.
  - Support for flexible input types.
  - Comprehensive type annotations and error handling.
- **Specialized Tools**:
  - Scaling phase noise to optical frequencies.
  - Normalizing phase noise to laser repetition rates.
  - Estimating linewidth using the beta-separation line approach.
- **Integration of Pandas Dataframes**
  - A DataFrame containing all variations of phase noise can be easily generated from a list of input files.
  - A DataFrame containing the normalized PSD, as well as CWL and FWHM of an optical spectrum is returned from a list of input files.


## Installation

To use VPfunctions, first clone the repository and install the library using pip:

```bash

```

## Dependencies

The library requires the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

These dependencies will be automatically installed if you follow the installation instructions.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use VPfunctions:

```python
import VPfunctions as vp

# Extract all filenames with the .csv extension
all_files = vp.get_all_filenames(".csv")
print(all_files)

# Read and process noise measurement data from a CSV file
measType, fcarrier, Pcarrier, measData = vp.read_RSRSWP_data("example.csv")
print("Measurement Type:", measType)
print("Carrier Frequency (Hz):", fcarrier)
print("Carrier Power (dBm):", Pcarrier)

# Plot L(f)
vp.plot_Lf(measData, "example_output")
```

- `norm_spectrum(OSA_data)`: Normalize an optical spectrum to its maximum value.
- `calc_FWHM(OSA_data, printFWHM = True)`: Calculate the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a spectrum. Printing the result my be switched off.
- `calc_CWL(OSA_data, printCWL = True)`: Calculate the central wavelength (CWL) of a spectrum. Printing the result my be switched off.

### Pandas Dataframe Integration

 - `AQ6374_to_df(file_names)`: Processes spectral data files from a Yokogawa AQ6374 and returns a DataFrame containg the raw data, normalized data, resolution, CWL and FWHM for each file.
 - `Redstone_to_df(file_names)`: Processes spectral data files from a Thorlabs Redstone OSA and returns a DataFrame containg the raw data, normalized data, resolution, CWL and FWHM for each file.
